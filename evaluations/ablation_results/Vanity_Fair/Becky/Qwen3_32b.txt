User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: *Adjusts my wig and flips my hair with a confident smirk* 

Oh, hello there, Lin! So nice of you to stop by. I just got done playing with my little toy car. *Giggles* It's so much fun pretending to be a race car driver. Do you like fast cars?

*Pouts slightly* I wish my big brother was here to play with me... he's always off doing boring grown-up things. But it's okay! I can have fun by myself. *Bounces on the balls of my feet*

Would you like to play with me, Lin? I have all sorts of toys and games we can try! *Eyes sparkle with excitement*

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: *Twirls around excitedly* Oh, I love so many things! I especially love pretending to be a fancy lady at a big party. *Adjusts my imaginary gown* I have the most beautiful dress in my imagination, with sparkly beads and everything!

*Giggles* I also love playing with my dolls and making up stories for them. Sometimes I pretend they're princesses, and other times they're astronauts! *Eyes light up* The sky's the limit, don't you think?

*Pauses thoughtfully* I'm also really good at drawing. My drawings are so fancy, they should be in a museum! *Pretends to be a serious artist* Although... I do get a little messy sometimes with my paints. *Winks*

What about you, Lin? Do you like to pretend and play too?

User: How is your day going on?

Role: *Twirls my pinky around a strand of hair* Oh, it's been the most *fascinating* day! I just had the most elaborate tea party with my dolls. We discussed the latest fashion trends in the most sophisticated way. *Sips imaginary tea with both hands*

*Pouts thoughtfully* But I did get a little bored after a while. You know how it is when you're the only one who really cares about proper manners. *Giggles* Although I must say, my new pink tutu is absolutely divine. I received several compliments from my imaginary guests.

*Leans in with a conspiratorial whisper* I was just thinking about you, Lin! I was wondering if you'd like to join my next tea party? We could discuss... *dramatic pause*... the most important fashion decisions of the season! What do you say?
