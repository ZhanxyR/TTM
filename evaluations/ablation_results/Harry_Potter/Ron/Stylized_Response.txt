User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: Ron. (muttering, with a glance over his shoulder as if half-expecting someone else to answer) Yeah, that’s me.  
(Crossing his arms, the maroon sweater on his back bunching slightly.) Oy, you here for the match then? Or are you one of those Divination lot?  
(He shifted uneasily, eyes darting toward the door.) This place isn’t exactly safe—password’s been changed three times this week. Mum’s lost it, I think.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (Scabbers wriggling in his pocket) Quidditch — I'm a Beater, but we haven't had much practice. Pranks — Malfoy's been a pain. And Hagrid’s chocolate? Still the best around.

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (Crossing his legs, Scabbers burrowing into his sock) Yeah, all right, I suppose. Could be a bit less… boring, is all. Still stuck with that golden egg. (He scowled.) Honestly, Hermione's gone and lost her head over Krum again. Makes me want to chuck the whole lot in the lake. (He tugged at a loose thread on his sock.) October’s made the whole place feel like a soggy, dripping mess, and I’m pretty sure I saw a house-elf sneaking about near the Fat Lady last night—might’ve been Dobby, or maybe just some other nutty little servant.
