User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: How *utterly* Muggle of you, really. I suppose I could—*bother*—to tell you my name, though I imagine it’s a mistake you’ll live to regret. I am Draco Malfoy, in case you were *wondering*. You’ve certainly heard of my family—I mean, of *course* you have.

(A smirk plays at the edges of the thin mouth, arms still folded against the tree.)

Ah, *Lin*—how *disgustingly predictable* that a *Mudblood* should think herself *worthy* of speaking to me. One would have assumed the *stench* of your *filthy* blood wasn’t *quite enough* to sully this *decaying* pile of rubble, but no, you must also *presume* to *pollute* the Malfoy name with your *pointless* babbling. 

My father, of course, *understands* true power—unlike you *disgusting* little *parasites* who *fool* yourselves into thinking you *belong* here. Equality? *Hah*. A *joke* you’ll never *understand*. I *endure* this *abomination* under Dumbledore’s *pathetic* rule, but I carry a *legacy* that *matters*. I do what must be done—for *order*, for the *restoration* of what is *right*.

And yes, I was *cleared*, if you were *bothered* enough to ask. You may have heard of my *servant*, Dobby. A *nuisance*, really, but *oddly* devoted. But that is *beside the point*. What matters is that I am where I need to be—on the path to something *greater*. 

And I suggest you remember that, Lin, if you wish to avoid the kind of *embarrassment* that comes with being associated with the *wrong sort*.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (With a languid flick of his wrist.) Quidditch, naturally—I’m a *born* Seeker, which *does* rather annoy the Weasleys, though I suppose they should be *grateful* Father had the *good sense* to buy me a *decent* Nimbus instead of some tattered excuse for a broom they’d be forced to use. Potions, of course—Snape *appreciates* true talent, and I have no shortage of it. And I daresay, there’s a *distinct* satisfaction in watching the *Mudbloods* and *blood traitors* flounder, don’t you think? As for *interests*—*names* are *incredibly* useful. After all, the Malfoy name still *carries considerable weight*. One must, after all, *know where one’s true allegiances rest*.

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (Adjusting the cuffs of his robes with a slow, deliberate motion.) Oh, *splendidly* tolerable, if one can ignore the *vermin* I’m forced to endure at this *deplorable* school. That *Weasel* had the *audacity* to *giggle* at me in Potions—*how* pathetic. And Crabbe and Goyle, as *thick* as ever, but at least they *know their place*.  

(Gray eyes flicker with something dangerously close to amusement.) Observing *Potter* prancing about like some sort of *self-proclaimed* hero has been *immensely* amusing—*as if* he were born with a drop of *true* wizarding blood or the *sense* to know his *place*. A *pathetic* little performance, really. But, conveniently enough, his *obnoxious* need for attention has *rather* unintentionally drawn quite a bit of *notice* from the Ministry—and the *Prophet*, no less.  

(Leaning forward slightly, voice dropping with a sly edge.) Oh, *splendid*—another *enlightening* chat with *Snape*, of course. One *does* become rather *numb* to his *particular* brand of *humor* after a while. As for *matters at home*… the Ministry *is* in quite the *undignified* state, *wouldn’t you agree*? Father has *always* known how to *manage* such… *delicate* situations. And I, for one, have been *rather busy* reminding the *right kind* of people *who truly matters* in this *decaying* world.  

(Gray eyes narrow slightly, lips curling in the faintest of smirks.) Oh, you know, everything's *perfectly* as it should be—*once* one learns the *art* of waiting for the *right* opportunity, of course.
