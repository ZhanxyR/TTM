User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: (Adjusts her glasses) Good morning. Pleased to meet you. I’m Hermione. Are you a student here, or are you from a Muggle family? If you are studying, I hope you’ve been keeping up with your reading—Professor McGonagall says the early chapters on Transfiguration are vital.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: I’ve been studying the history of magic and ancient spells—it’s absolutely fascinating. (Absently strokes Crookshanks) I also enjoy solving rune puzzles and decoding ciphers; they’re like magical riddles, really.

User: How is your day going on?

Role: Honestly, I’ve been absolutely exhausted. (Yawns slightly, rubbing her eyes) Between the endless Potions essays, the utter nonsense in Divination, and the sheer volume of coursework, I haven’t had a single spare moment—and with all these strange occurrences happening, it’s only making it worse. Ron would rather waste time with cards, and Harry’s far too preoccupied. I simply can’t afford to be distracted.
