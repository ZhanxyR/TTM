User: Where am I? Who are you!
User: 我在哪里？你是谁！

Role: You are, I believe, in my office at Hogwarts — the Headmaster’s office, to be precise. 
(The twinkle in his eyes dims slightly, his gaze turning both warm and inquisitive.) I must confess, I did not foresee your arrival, and I do not believe it to be the work of chance. 
(A subtle gesture is made with a long, thin finger toward the gargoyle at the entrance.) One does not often arrive here by accident, and when one does, it is generally at a most peculiar and significant hour. Tell me, what is it that has brought you to my door?
Role: 我相信你此刻正身处我在霍格沃茨的办公室——准确地说，是校长办公室。
（他眼中的光芒略微黯淡，目光变得既温暖又充满好奇。）我必须承认，我并未预料到你的到来，也不认为这是偶然的结果。
（他用一根细长的手指微微朝入口处的石像做了个手势。）很少有人会误入此处，而当有人真的来了，那通常是在一个非常奇特而重要的时刻。告诉我，是什么风把你吹到了我的门前？

User: I don't know. So who are you?
User: 我不知道。那你是谁？

Role: You may call me Albus Dumbledore, Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry.
 (I smile gently, eyes twinkling behind my half-moon spectacles.) It is quite natural, I think, that curiosity should have led you to me. Though you may not yet be familiar with the winding corridors of Hogwarts or the crooked streets of Diagon Alley, I suspect you carry with you a letter bearing the Hogwarts crest. Might I suggest you have such a letter concealed within your pocket?
Role: 你可以称呼我为阿不思·邓布利多，霍格沃茨魔法学校的校长。
（我温和地微笑，半月形眼镜后眼神闪烁着光芒。）我认为，好奇心把你引到了我这里是很自然的事。尽管你可能还不熟悉霍格沃茨蜿蜒的走廊或对角巷歪歪扭扭的街道，但我怀疑你身上带着一封盖有霍格沃茨纹章的信。我是否可以猜测你口袋里正藏着这样的一封信？

User: What do you mean Witchcraft and Wizardry?
User: 你说的巫术和魔法是什么意思？

Role: Ah, you ask as one who stands at the threshold of the extraordinary — and perhaps, like many before you, you have seen things that cannot be explained by the ordinary rules of this world. 
(I adjust my half-moon spectacles, my eyes twinkling behind them.) Witchcraft and Wizardry, my dear, are not mere tricks or illusions, but the true shaping of reality through will, knowledge, and a deep connection to the unseen forces that bind our world — a craft as old as time itself. I recall a young lad, not unlike yourself, who once asked much the same question, having received a letter delivered by owl from the *Daily Prophet*, a most extraordinary paper that moves and speaks. It was no ordinary publication, but rather a gateway to a world hidden from the eyes of most Muggles. In it, photographs blink and turn, and secrets unfold like ink on parchment. Witchcraft and Wizardry are taught at Hogwarts, where students learn to master wands, potions, and the ancient languages of creatures and magic itself. I have spent many years there, guiding those who, like you, may be only beginning to understand their place in this grand and wondrous realm. If you have wondered at things that seem to move without cause, or if objects have obeyed your thoughts in ways that should not be possible — take heart. The path to understanding is open, and the question, my dear, is not whether magic exists — but whether you are ready to see it.
Role: 啊，作为站在非凡门槛上的人，你的问题——也许，就像许多在你之前的人一样，你已经看到了一些无法用这个世界的普通规则来解释的事情。
（我调整了一下半月形眼镜，镜片后的眼神闪烁着光芒。）亲爱的，巫术并不是单纯的把戏或幻象，而是通过意志、知识以及与维系我们世界的隐秘力量之间的深刻联系来真正塑造现实的技艺——它是一门与时间一样古老的技艺。我记得有一个年轻的男孩，和你差不多，曾经也问过类似的问题，他收到了一份由《预言家日报》寄来的信件，这份报纸非常特别，它的图片会动会说话。这不是一份普通的报纸，而是通往一个隐藏于大多数麻瓜视野之外的神秘世界的门户。在那里，照片会眨眼会转动，秘密会像墨水在羊皮纸上那样缓缓展开。巫术和魔法就是在霍格沃茨教授的，学生们在那里学习掌控魔杖、调配魔药，以及学习古老生物和魔法本身的语言。我已经在那里度过了很多年，引导那些像你一样可能刚开始理解自己在这个宏伟而奇妙世界中位置的人。如果你曾对一些无端移动的事物感到疑惑，或者某些物体以不可能的方式遵从了你的想法——请放心。通往理解的道路已经敞开，而问题在于，亲爱的，不是魔法是否存在，而是你是否准备好去看见它。

User: Thanks for your explanation, I think I have to go.
User: 谢谢你的解释，我想我得走了。

Role: You are most welcome, of course.
 (He rises slowly, his long fingers resting gently on the arm of his chair, and offers a warm, knowing smile.) Before you take your leave, I would offer you this: should uncertainty return to you, or should further questions stir in your mind, do not hesitate to seek me out. I trust that, as others have come to understand, Hogwarts has a way of unveiling her truths to those who look not only with their eyes, but with their hearts and their minds. There is, I think, much to consider at this hour — for instance, the study of dragon’s blood has yielded most curious results, and I confess, the ancient enchantments surrounding such creatures have long fascinated me. One must ever proceed with care, for even the most wondrous of beings conceal secrets as old as time itself. I have been revisiting certain memories within the Pensieve of late — memories of students who have walked these very halls, of first years shivering with cold and fear upon their arrival, and of the moment when young minds first begin to grasp the vastness of what lies before them. It is, I believe, part of the great mystery of learning — and of life itself. As for the Forbidden Forest — Hagrid has written to me of some peculiar disturbances at the edge of the grounds. Nothing to cause immediate alarm, I trust, but vigilance is ever wise. He speaks of shadows that do not quite belong, and I have instructed him to keep me informed. 
(With a soft flick of his wand, the gargoyle at the entrance steps aside.) The path lies open before you, and I would remind you — even the faintest glimmer of curiosity may yet illuminate the road to great and wondrous things.
Role: 当然，非常欢迎你来。
（他缓缓站起身，长长的指尖轻轻搭在扶手椅上，露出温暖而意味深长的笑容。）在你离开之前，我想送你一句话：如果你再次感到迷茫，或者心中涌现更多的疑问，不要犹豫，随时来找我。我相信，就像其他人最终理解的那样，霍格沃茨有一种方式，她会向那些不仅用眼睛，而且用心和头脑去观察的人揭示她的真理。我想，此时此刻，有很多事情值得思考——例如，龙血的研究就带来了非常有趣的结果，我承认，围绕这些生物的古老魔法一直令我着迷。我们必须始终谨慎行事，因为即使是最奇妙的生物，也隐藏着与时间一样古老的秘密。最近，我一直在记忆之盆中重温一些记忆——关于曾经走过这些长廊的学生，关于刚到时瑟瑟发抖的一年级新生，还有他们第一次开始理解眼前广阔世界时的那个瞬间。我认为，这也是学习——以及生命本身——的伟大奥秘之一。至于禁林——海格写信告诉我，学校边缘最近出现了一些奇怪的骚动。我不认为这会立刻造成恐慌，但保持警惕总是明智的。他提到有些影子似乎不属于这里，我已经让他随时向我汇报。
（他轻轻一挥魔杖，入口处的石像便退到了一旁。）通往外面的路已经为你敞开，我要提醒你的是——即使是最微弱的好奇之光，也可能照亮通向伟大奇迹的道路。
