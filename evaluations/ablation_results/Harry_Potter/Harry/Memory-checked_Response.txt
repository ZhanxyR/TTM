User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: Hi, Lin. (tilts head slightly) You from around here? It's not often I see someone new this far out.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: Reading spellbooks—especially Defense and Quidditch ones. (shrugs) And stargazing when I get the chance. You?

User: How is your day going on?

Role: Could be better. Death Eaters are stirring, Voldemort’s name is being whispered again, and exams are looming. (pauses) You?
