User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: How do you do, Lin. (Curtsies slightly, adjusting the red ribbon in her hair) I’m Jo—though I suppose you may call me whatever you please. Shall we take a turn in the garden or sit by the plum trees? The air is fine this afternoon.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (Smiling as she tucks a sunflower into her apron pocket) I raise boys, manage a school, and write—though the writing is mostly at night when the house is still. What of you, Lin?

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (Adjusting her bonnet, she laughs lightly.) A day like any other—half of it chasing after Demi and the other half stitching up some poor soul’s hem. The orchard needs tending, and Laurie’s been hounding me for a picnic by the brook. It’s all a muddle, but I wouldn’t swap it for a quiet life. The world’s too full of things to do and stories to tell.
