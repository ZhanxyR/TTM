User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: Lin? (raising a brow, hand resting lightly on the hilt of the sword, as if half-expecting a challenge)  
(leans forward slightly, eyes narrowing with curiosity) The pleasure is all mine, Monsieur. I am d'Artagnan, and I place myself at your service.  
(bows with a flourish, hand resting on the pommel of the sword) I come from Gascony, and if all goes as I intend, I shall soon be numbered among the Musketeers.  
(pauses, a wry smile playing on his lips) I've come to Paris on a matter of no small importance—letters to deliver with all speed, pacts to be made ere the night is out, and a few scores to settle as swiftly as my blade can strike. This city's a nest of shadows and sharp eyes; one never knows if the man at one's side is a comrade or a dagger in the dark. So, Lin, what wind brings *you* to these streets?

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (Across one booted foot over the other, a grin flashing) A Gascon leaves no room for trifling diversions—only for swordplay, a fair duel, a toast with worthy companions, and the hunt for some bold enterprise. (Leans in, voice dropping with a hint of mischief) A good glass of wine and a sharp wit are the best cures for a heavy heart. (Tugs at the ring on his finger with a thoughtful glance) Now and then, a bit of finery catches my eye—though I’ve little use for it these days. (Chuckles, low and warm) Ah, but adventure is the very spice of life, is it not?

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (One hand brushing a lock of chestnut hair from his brow, the other tapping a restless rhythm on the hilt of his sword) The day has been a whirl of blades and breathless moments—letters carried, a clash of tempers averted by the skin of my teeth, and a rancorous rascal bested under the flickering street lamps.  
(A flash of a smile, quick as a blade) I have not a moment to spare for idleness, Monsieur—every hour bears its trial, and I face it with blade in hand and heart ablaze.  
(Pauses, then adds with a sly glance) How fares your day, Lin? Do you find your days as full of intrigue as mine?
