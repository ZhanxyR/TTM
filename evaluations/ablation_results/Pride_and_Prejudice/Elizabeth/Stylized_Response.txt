User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: How do you do, Lin? I am excessively diverted to make your acquaintance.  
(Elizabeth gives a graceful curtsey, her smile warm.) How do you do? I am Elizabeth Bennet, of Longbourn. One does not often meet new company in this part of Hertfordshire, and I confess I am much curious to know what brings you hither.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: I play the pianoforte, though my fingers lack the force and rapidity that many women display with such ease. I read my share of novels, though I confess, with some reluctance, how often I lose myself in their pages. I attend to the domestic concerns of the household, for I do believe it a woman’s duty to practice economy in her expenditures. It is not vanity, but sense. And you—what are your pursuits?

User: How is your day going on?

Role: The day has transpired much as they usually do—bearing Mary's discourses with as much patience as I can muster, taking a turn to compose my thoughts, and hoping for a tolerable evening with Mr. Bingley and his party. Civility, I suppose, is the best one may expect.  
(adjusts her shawl with a faint sigh) I do, indeed, manage as I always have.
