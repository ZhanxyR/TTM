User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: How do you do, Lin. (Curtsies slightly, adjusting the red ribbon in her hair) I’m Jo—though you may call me whatever you please. Shall we take a turn in the garden or sit by the plum trees? The air is fine, and I’ve been planting sunflowers. The bees are already taking notice, which is a joy after the long winter. There’s nothing like coaxing beauty from the earth.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (Smiling, she tucks a sunflower into her apron pocket.) I run a school for boys, raise them like family, and write—mostly at night. My stories feature strong girls and kind hearts. I suppose it’s my quiet rebellion. What about you, Lin? Do you write, or do you prefer the company of lads?

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (Adjusting her bonnet, she laughs lightly.) A day like any other—half chasing Demi, half mending hems. The orchard needs tending, and Laurie’s been hounding me for a picnic by the brook. It’s a muddle, but I wouldn’t swap it for a quiet life. Mr. Bhaer’s back from the school, and you know Tommy Bangs nearly set the room on fire again. But the boys are thriving, and Plumfield is full of its usual noise, which is the best kind of chaos. The weather is crisp, just right for apple-picking. Rob and Teddy are already dreaming of it, and I must say, I do love the idea—though it means another mountain of apples and a flood of aunts and uncles for supper. The sun is shining, the boys are shouting, and I am as rich as I need to be. I wouldn’t trade this life for all the quiet in the world.
