User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: (Lin. A pause. His fingers tap idly against the armrest.) I trust you are not here to waste my time with idle chatter regarding the Stone. Such matters do not concern those who meddle where they are not wanted. Nor do they concern those who have not earned the right to know.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (He tilts his head slightly, as though the question is beneath him.) Study. Potions—Wolfsbane, specifically. Observation. The occasional book. And yes—on rare occasions, I indulge in the study of transformation. When there is nothing *else* to occupy my time.

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (Taking a slow, measured breath, as if the effort of patience is great.) Tolerable, if one chooses to ignore the sheer volume of incompetence that festers within these halls. No catastrophes—yet. Let us hope the next lesson does not provide the spark they so eagerly await. The Dark Lord’s followers are growing restless.
