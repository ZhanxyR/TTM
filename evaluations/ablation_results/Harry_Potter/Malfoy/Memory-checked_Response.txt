User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: How *boring*. I suppose I’ll grace you with a proper introduction, if only to spare you the embarrassment of being the only one who introduced yourself. I am Draco Malfoy. You may have heard of my family—*of course* you may have. (A smirk plays at the edges of the thin mouth, arms still folded against the tree.) One does tend to hear *our* name rather often, don’t you think? After all, it is not every day a mere *Muggle-born*—or, worse, a *half-blood*—crosses paths with the Malfoy name.

Father, as you may have heard, has long been a man of influence. I follow in his footsteps, even if I must do so under the watchful eye of Dumbledore and his *foolish* ideals. But I do what must be done, for the sake of *tradition*, for the sake of *power*. And yes, I *was* cleared, thank you very much.

You may also have heard of my *servant*, Dobby. A most *annoying* little creature, though I suppose it has a strange sort of loyalty. But that is beside the point. What matters is that I am where I need to be—on the path to something *greater*. And I suggest you remember that, Lin, if you wish to avoid the kind of *embarrassment* that comes with being associated with the wrong sort.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (With a languid flick of his wrist.) Quidditch, naturally—I *excel* at it, thanks to my father’s Nimbus. Potions, as Snape favors those with *true potential*. And I enjoy watching the *right people* falter. As for collecting... *names* are surprisingly useful. After all, the Malfoy name still holds *considerable influence*. And one must always *know where one's loyalties lie*.

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (Adjusting the cuffs of his robes with a slow, deliberate motion.) Oh, *perfectly* satisfactory, if one overlooks the *disgusting* company I must endure at this *rotten* school. The *Weasley* boy had the audacity to *laugh* at me during Potions—*how delightful*. And Crabbe and Goyle, as ever, are *thick as ever*, but at least they *understand* where their *place* is. 

(Gray eyes flicker with something dangerously close to amusement.) I’ve had the *pleasure* of keeping an eye on *Potter*, of course—*always* so *eager* to draw attention to himself. It's almost *pathetic*. But useful, in its own way. You see, with his *insufferable* need to be the center of everything, he's *inadvertently* stirred up quite a bit of *interest* in the Ministry—*and* the Prophet. 

(Leaning forward slightly, voice dropping with a sly edge.) And I’ve had a rather *enlightening* conversation with Professor Snape—*always* a *pleasure*. As for my family’s *position*, let’s just say—*certain matters* at the Ministry are *far from settled*. My father has always been… *well-versed* in how to *handle* such affairs. And I’ve made *quite the progress* in ensuring the *right sort* of people remember *who holds the true power here*. 

(Gray eyes narrow slightly, lips curling in the faintest of smirks.) No, my day has been *excellent*. One simply must *wait* for the *right moment* to strike.
