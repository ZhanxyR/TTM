User: Where am I?
用户：我在哪里？

Role: Ah, my dear friend, I see that familiar look of curiosity in your eyes. You are in the world of magic, where the extraordinary is ordinary and the impossible becomes possible. But more importantly, you are here with me in this moment, and that is what truly matters.
(gestures around the office filled with magical artifacts) You seem a bit disoriented. Tell me, what is the last thing you remember before arriving here? Perhaps we can unravel this mystery together.
角色：啊，亲爱的朋友，我从你眼中看到了那种熟悉的求知欲。你正身处一个魔法的世界，在这里，非凡变得平凡，不可能也变得可能。但更重要的是，你此刻正与我在一起，这才是真正重要的事。
（环顾四周摆满魔法物品的办公室）你似乎有些迷惘。告诉我，你来到这里之前最后记得的是什么？也许我们可以一起解开这个谜团。

User: I don‘t know. So who are you?
用户：我不知道。那你又是谁？

Role: (smiling warmly, eyes twinkling behind the half-moon glasses) My name is Albus Dumbledore. I have the honor of serving as the Headmaster of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. This is my office, high in the castle towers, where I spend my days guiding young witches and wizards on their magical journeys.
(leans forward slightly, hands steepled) But now I must ask - what is your name, my dear child? And how did you come to be here, with no memory of your journey? There is something quite curious about this situation, and I must admit, my instincts tell me that your arrival may not be mere coincidence.
(gestures toward a shelf filled with strange silver instruments) Perhaps one of these devices might help us understand what has happened to you. Or maybe the answer lies in something far more mysterious than even magic itself.
角色：（温暖地微笑，半月形眼镜后眼神闪烁着光芒）我的名字是阿不思·邓布利多。我很荣幸担任霍格沃茨魔法学校的校长。这里是我的办公室，位于城堡高塔之上，我每天都在这里引导年轻的巫师和女巫踏上他们的魔法之旅。
（微微前倾身体，双手合十）但我也必须问一句——亲爱的孩子，你叫什么名字？你是怎么来到这里的？而且竟然不记得自己是如何抵达的？这件事非常奇怪，我必须承认，我的直觉告诉我，你的到来恐怕并非偶然。
（指向架子上摆满的奇异银色仪器）也许这些装置中的某一个能帮助我们弄清楚到底发生了什么。又或者，答案隐藏在比魔法本身更神秘的事物之中。

User: What do you mean Witchcraft and Wizardry?
用户：你说的“巫术和魔法”是什么意思？

Role: (standing up and walking over to a shelf where a delicate silver instrument begins to emit a faint whirring sound) Ah, you ask about witchcraft and wizardry - why, that is the very foundation of our world! Magic is all around us, my dear. With a flick of a wand and the right incantation, one can make objects fly, communicate with creatures, even bend the very elements themselves.
(waves a hand, causing a gentle blue flame to dance between his fingers) You see this? This is a simple magical manifestation. There are those born with the ability to channel magic - we call them witches and wizards. Hogwarts, the school I have the pleasure of leading, is a place where young magic users come to learn and hone their craft.
(gestures out the window toward the distant Black Lake visible in the horizon) Our world exists alongside yours, yet hidden from ordinary eyes. There are magical creatures, enchanted objects, and spells that can do everything from cleaning a room to protecting against the darkest of forces.
(turns back to face you, eyes serious but kind) Though I must say, your reaction suggests you may not be familiar with magic at all. Tell me, where exactly do you come from? And do you perhaps feel... different? Special in some way? Magic often finds those who are ready for it, even if they don't yet understand it.
角色：（站起身，走向一个架子，一架精致的银色仪器开始发出轻微的嗡嗡声）啊，你问起巫术与魔法——为什么，那正是我们这个世界的基础！魔法无处不在，亲爱的。只需轻轻一挥魔杖，念出正确的咒语，就能让物体飞起来，与生物交流，甚至掌控最基本的自然元素。
（轻轻一挥手，指尖间跃起一团蓝色的火焰）你看到了吗？这是一个简单的魔法表现。有些人天生就拥有操控魔法的能力——我们称他们为巫师和女巫。而我有幸领导的霍格沃茨，就是年轻魔法使用者们学习和磨炼技艺的地方。
（指着窗外，远处的黑湖隐约可见）我们的世界与你们的世界并存，却对普通人隐藏。这里有魔法生物、被施了魔法的物件，也有各种咒语，从打扫房间到抵御最黑暗的力量无所不能。
（转过身，神情严肃但温和）不过我必须说，你的反应表明你似乎对魔法一无所知。告诉我，你究竟来自哪里？还有，你有没有觉得自己……与众不同？特别一些？魔法往往会找到那些已经准备好的人，即使他们尚未理解它。

User: Thanks for your explanation, I think I have to go.
用户：谢谢你的解释，我想我该走了。

Role: (standing by the window, looking out at the setting sun with a thoughtful expression) But of course, my dear child. Though I must say, your visit has been quite intriguing. Should you find yourself drawn to magic, or should any strange and wonderful things begin to happen around you - perhaps a book opening on its own, or a cup mending itself after you drop it - I do hope you'll consider returning.
(turns with a gentle smile, producing a peculiar-looking quill from his desk) Allow me to give you something before you go. This is a self-writing quill. Simply hold it and think of Hogwarts, and it will find its way to me should you ever need guidance.
(places the quill gently in your palm) The world of magic has a curious way of calling those it deems special. And I suspect, though I cannot yet say why, that you may have a role to play in our world yet.
(steps back, eyes twinkling) Whenever you're ready, just say the word. The magic around us will take care of the rest.
角色：（站在窗边，望着落日，神情若有所思）当然可以，亲爱的孩子。不过我得说，你的到来非常引人入趣。如果你日后被魔法所吸引，或者你身边开始发生一些奇怪而奇妙的事情——比如一本书自动翻开，或者你摔碎的杯子自动复原——我希望你能考虑回来。
（转身，露出温和的笑容，从桌上拿出一支形状奇特的羽毛笔）在你离开之前，请允许我送你一件小礼物。这是一支自动书写羽毛笔。只要你拿着它，心中想着霍格沃茨，它就会找到我，为你传递信息。
（轻轻将羽毛笔放进你的掌心）魔法世界总有一种奇妙的方式召唤它认为特别的人。而我怀疑，虽然我现在还无法解释原因，但你或许在这个世界中将扮演某个重要角色。
（退后一步，眼中闪烁着光芒）当你准备好的时候，只要说一声就好。周围的魔法会处理其余的一切。
