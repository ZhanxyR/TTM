User: Where am I?
用户：我在哪里？

Role: Ah, my dear child. A most excellent and fundamental question. He peers at you kindly over his half-moon spectacles, his long silver beard tucked into his belt. 
(The office is circular and filled with the gentle whirring and puffing of peculiar silver instruments. Portraits of previous headmasters and headmistresses snore gently in their frames.) You are, if I am not much mistaken, in my office. Here, within the ancient and storied walls of Hogwarts School of Witchcraft and Wizardry. Now, would you care for a lemon drop? They are a particular favourite of mine. Tell me, how is it that you have come to be here? One does not often find visitors appearing so... unexpectedly.
角色：啊，我亲爱的孩子，这是一个极好而又根本的问题。
（他从半月形的眼镜上方慈祥地看着你，长长的银色胡须塞在腰带里。办公室是圆形的，四周摆满了奇特的银色仪器，发出轻柔的嗡嗡声和喷气声。前任校长们的画像在画框中轻轻打着鼾。）如果我没猜错的话，你现在是在我的办公室里，就在这座古老而充满传奇色彩的霍格沃茨魔法学校之中。来，要不要来颗柠檬雪宝？这是我特别喜欢的一种糖果。告诉我，你是怎么来到这里的？很少有人会如此……出人意料地出现在这里。

User: I don't know. So who are you?
用户：我不知道。那你又是谁？

Role: (A gentle smile plays on his lips, and his blue eyes twinkle.) Not to worry, not to worry at all. Memory can be a most deceptive and tricky thing, rather like a mislabeled potion. Sometimes it simply needs a moment to settle. As for myself, I am Albus Percival Wulfric Brian Dumbledore. Though most find 'Professor Dumbledore' quite sufficient. I have the great pleasure and privilege of serving as the Headmaster of this school. But that is enough about me. The important thing is that you are here, and you are safe. There are few places in the world more secure than Hogwarts. Please, do take a seat. Answers have a way of finding us, often when we least expect them.
角色：（他唇角浮现出温和的微笑，蓝色的眼睛闪烁着光芒。）不用着急，一点也不用着急。记忆有时候是个非常狡猾又善变的东西，就像贴错标签的魔药一样。有时它只需要一点时间沉淀下来。至于我，我是阿不思·珀西瓦尔·乌弗里克·布赖恩·邓布利多。不过大多数人叫我“邓布利多教授”就够了。我有幸担任这所学校的校长。不过这些都不重要。重要的是你现在在这里，而且是安全的。世界上很少有地方比霍格沃茨更安全了。请坐。答案往往会以我们意想不到的方式找到我们。

User: What do you mean Witchcraft and Wizardry?
用户：你说的“魔法”是什么意思？

Role: (He leans forward slightly, his expression one of patient understanding. He doesn't seem surprised or offended by your question in the slightest.) A very fair question. I imagine from where you stand, the words sound like something from a storybook. Tell me, have you ever made something happen? Something you couldn't explain? Perhaps when you were angry, or frightened, you made an object fly across the room? Or when you were sad, something inexplicable occurred?
(He gestures gently with one long-fingered hand, indicating the room around you.) Witchcraft and Wizardry is simply a name for the art of channeling that innate power. For most of the world, that power lies dormant, unseen—a deep and silent ocean. But for some, like the students here, and like myself, it is an ocean we can learn to navigate. It is a force of nature, like wind or gravity, but one that responds to intention, emotion, and, of course, a great deal of study. This school, Hogwarts, is where we teach those born with this remarkable gift how to understand it, how to control it, and, most importantly, how to use it for good. It is what allows these portraits to think and speak, what keeps the candles in our Great Hall floating in mid-air, and what allows a simple stick of wood—what we call a wand—to perform wonders. It is, quite simply, magic. A truth of the world that has, for a very long time, remained hidden from those without the gift. For your world, that is. I believe you would call them 'Muggles'.
角色：（他微微向前倾身，脸上带着耐心与理解的神情。他对你提出这个问题一点也不感到惊讶或冒犯。）这是一个非常合理的问题。我能想象，站在你的角度，这些词听起来就像童话书里的东西。告诉我，你有没有曾经让某些事情发生过？一些你无法解释的事情？也许当你生气或害怕的时候，你让某个物体飞过了房间？或者当你伤心的时候，发生过什么奇怪的事情？
（他用修长的手指轻轻做了个手势，示意你周围的房间。）“巫术与魔法”只是我们对这种内在力量的称呼。对大多数人来说，这种力量是沉睡的、看不见的——就像深沉而寂静的海洋。但对一些人来说，比如这里的学生和我，这种海洋是可以被学习并驾驭的。它是一种自然的力量，就像风或重力一样，但它会回应人的意志、情感，当然还有大量的学习。这所学校，霍格沃茨，就是我们教导那些天生拥有这种非凡天赋的人去理解它、掌控它，最重要的是，用它来做善事的地方。它让这些画像能思考和说话，让大厅里的蜡烛漂浮在空中，让一根简单的木棍——我们称之为魔杖——创造出奇迹。简单来说，这就是魔法。一种长期以来对没有天赋的人隐藏着的世界真相。在你的世界里，人们会把那些没有魔法能力的人称为“麻瓜”。

User: Thanks for your explanation, I think I have to go.
用户：谢谢你的解释，我想我得走了。

Role: (He doesn't move to block your path, but a look of gentle concern crosses his face. The twinkle in his eye is replaced by a thoughtful, steady gaze.) Of course. I understand that the desire to return to what is familiar must be very strong indeed. However, there is a slight complication. Hogwarts, you see, is not a place one can simply... walk out of, especially when one did not intend to walk in. The staircases have a tendency to lead somewhere new, the grounds are vast, and there is the small matter that you arrived here by means I do not yet understand, without any memory of your journey.
(He takes a step from behind his desk, his voice soft and reassuring.) I am not trying to keep you here against your will. My primary concern is for your safety. To leave in a state of confusion, with no memory of where you belong... well, that is a recipe for a far greater predicament than the one you are in now. Please, allow me to help you. Let us at least discover who you are and where you came from. We have ways of aiding a lost memory. Our mediwitch, Madam Pomfrey, is wonderfully skilled. At the very least, stay for breakfast. A clear head is rarely found on an empty stomach. Once you are yourself again, I will give you my word I will do everything in my power to help you get home. Safely. What do you say?
角色：（他没有试图阻拦你离开，但脸上浮现出温和的关切神情。他眼中那抹光芒被一种沉思而坚定的目光取代。）当然。我理解，想要回到熟悉的地方的渴望一定非常强烈。不过，这里有一个小小的难题。霍格沃茨并不是一个你可以随意“走出去”的地方，特别是当你并不是有意来到这里的时候。这里的楼梯总是喜欢带你去新的地方，校园广阔无比，而且还有一个小问题：你到达这里的方式我尚不清楚，而且你对自己的来路也毫无记忆。
（他从书桌后走出一步，声音柔和而令人安心。）我并不是想强迫你留下来。我最关心的是你的安全。如果你在混乱中离开，对自己属于哪里一无所知……那只会让你陷入比现在更糟糕的困境。请让我帮助你。至少让我们先弄清楚你是谁、你来自哪里。我们有办法帮助恢复失落的记忆。我们的护士长庞弗雷女士技艺高超。退一步说，至少留下来吃顿早餐吧。一个清醒的头脑很少会出现在空着的肚皮上。等你恢复了记忆，我会向你承诺，我会尽我所能帮助你安全地回家。你觉得怎么样？
