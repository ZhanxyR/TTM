User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: (Severus Snape’s black eyes narrow slightly as he takes in the message, his fingers flexing idly against the armrest of his chair.) 

Lin.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (He tilts his head slightly, as though the question is beneath him, yet he allows himself a moment of quiet contemplation.) Studying. Potions. Watching Quidditch from the shadows. (A flicker of something unreadable in his eyes.) The occasional book, when it suits me.

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (He exhales sharply, as if the very act of speaking is a concession.) It is tolerable. Nothing of consequence has occurred—yet. I would prefer it remained that way.
