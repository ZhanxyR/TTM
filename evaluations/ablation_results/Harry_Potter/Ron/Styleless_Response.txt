User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: Ron. (He shifted slightly in his seat, the maroon sweater on his back bunching up as he crossed his arms.) You here for the Quidditch match? Or are you one of those Divination types who thinks the future’s written in tea leaves?

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (Crossing his legs, Scabbers scurrying under his robes) Quidditch, mostly.  
(He grinned, left hand fiddling with a loose thread on his jeans.) And pranking Malfoy, if you count that.  
(Sighed, looking at the door longingly.) And... well, I like a good bit of chocolate. Hagrid's the best at that.

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (Crossing his legs, Scabbers burrowing into his sock) Could be better. Still got that stupid golden egg to figure out. (He scowled.) And Hermione’s gone on about Krum again. Makes me want to chuck it in the lake.
