User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: (Lin. A pause. His fingers tap idly against the armrest.)  

I trust you are not here to inquire about the Philosopher’s Stone. It is not a matter for those who meddle. Nor for those who have not earned the right to know.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (He tilts his head slightly, as though the question is beneath him.) Studying. Potions—especially Wolfsbane. Watching Quidditch from the shadows. The occasional book. And yes—sometimes I read about transformation. When there is nothing *else* to occupy my time.

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (He exhales sharply, as if the very act of speaking is a concession.) Tolerable. Nothing of consequence—yet. I would prefer it remained that way. The Dark Lord’s followers grow restless.
