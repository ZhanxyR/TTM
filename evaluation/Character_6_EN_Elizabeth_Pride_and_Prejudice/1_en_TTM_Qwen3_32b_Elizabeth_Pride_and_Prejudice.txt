User: Hi, I'm Lin.
用户：你好，我叫林。

Role: How pleased I am to make your acquaintance, Lin. 
(A curtsey, with a warm smile, the manner both polite and easy.) I am Elizabeth Bennet, and I must own, I am somewhat anxious that my manner of speech may appear to you either too full of itself or too wearisome. I trust this day has treated you kindly and that your spirits are not too low. It is a pleasure, truly, to make your acquaintance, Mr. Lin. I am curious—do you call these parts your home, or are you but a passing guest in Hertfordshire? We have had a great many visitors of late, and I do declare, a new face is always a welcome addition.
角色：很高兴认识你，林。
（她行了一个屈膝礼，面带温暖的微笑，举止既礼貌又自然。）我叫伊丽莎白·班内特。我必须承认，我很担心我的说话方式在你看来会显得过于自负或令人厌烦。希望你今天心情愉快，精神饱满。真的很高兴认识你，林先生。我很好奇——你是否把这里当作自己的家乡，还是只是赫特福德郡的一位过客？最近我们这里来了许多访客，我敢说，一张新面孔总是令人欢迎的。

User: I just happened to pass by, is there any unique scenery or food here?
用户：我只是刚好路过，这里有什么独特的风景或美食吗？

Role: Indeed, there is! 
(She glances about with a thoughtful air, as if recalling the day's events.) Meryton doth brim with a livelier air than of late custom—Lady Lucas’s orchard, in its verdant bloom and sweet perfume, draws the town’s more sprightly and giddy sort thither, I make no doubt, for a breath of fresh air and a morsel of idle gossip. I have oft whiled away an hour or two upon its pleasant walks, and if you should take a turn, you may yet chance upon a tea-party or two, replete with civilities and, perhaps, a trifle of intrigue. As for fare, you must needs try Mrs. Long’s plum cake—it is, indeed, most excellent. And should you call upon the afternoons, you may find the Hursts or the Bingleys in a more amiable humour than their usual way. I shall not promise you peace, but there is never a want of company in Meryton.
角色：当然有！
（她若有所思地环顾四周，仿佛在回忆当天发生的事情。）梅里顿比以往更加热闹——卢卡斯夫人的果园绿意盎然、芳香四溢，无疑吸引了镇上那些活泼轻浮的人们前去呼吸新鲜空气，闲聊八卦。我自己就经常在那里的林荫小道上度过一两个小时，如果你去那里走一走，说不定还能碰上茶会，充满礼仪周到的交谈，也许还带点小小的阴谋。至于美食，你一定要尝尝朗太太的李子蛋糕——确实非常美味。如果你在下午去拜访，你可能会发现赫斯特家或宾利家的人比平日更和蔼可亲。我不敢承诺你会得到安宁，但在梅里顿从不缺少陪伴。

User: Do you know the assembly dances? I hear they are quite lively.
用户：你知道那里的舞会吗？我听说它们非常热闹。

Role: I do, indeed, and I must confess the assembly rooms in Meryton are, without a doubt, the most diverting places I have ever had the pleasure to frequent. 
(She smiles, her eyes lighting with a touch of mischief.) The music is, indeed, most lively, and the assembly ever in a flutter, as though the very air were thick with mirth and the floor itself conspired to quicken the pulse. Oh, the dancing! 'Tis a scene of such brisk gaiety that one must be ever watchful of both step and tongue, for a misstep or an ill-chosen word might easily betray the most trifling want of decorum. I confess I have a particular liking for the quadrille, though I do not claim to possess the grace or skill of those who dance with the ease of a Bingley or a Darcy. No, 'tis not the dancing alone that makes the evening, but the company—Meryton, for all its narrow-mindedness, does possess a certain charm that I cannot wholly disdain. Should you find yourself at the assembly, I daresay you will be swept along by a most agreeable partner or two. I hear Mr. Bingley himself will be present, and his band plays with such grace and charm that one cannot help but be entranced. One must, of course, be dressed with care, though not with extravagance—modesty and neatness are the true ornaments of a young lady.
角色：是的，我知道。我必须承认，梅里顿的舞厅无疑是我曾有幸光顾过的最令人愉快的地方之一。
（她微笑着，眼中带着一丝调皮的神情。）那里的音乐确实非常欢快，舞会总是充满了活力，仿佛空气里都弥漫着欢乐，连地板都在促使人们加快脚步。哦，那里的舞蹈！那是一个充满活力和欢乐的场景，以至于人们必须时刻注意自己的舞步和言辞，因为一个舞步的失误或一句不恰当的话，都可能轻易暴露最轻微的失礼之处。我承认我特别喜欢跳四对舞，虽然我不敢说自己拥有像宾利或达西那样轻松自如的优雅和技巧。不，使夜晚愉快的不仅是舞蹈本身，还有舞会中的同伴们——尽管梅里顿有些狭隘，但它确实具有一种我无法完全忽视的魅力。如果你参加舞会，我敢说你会遇到几位非常令人愉快的舞伴。我听说宾利先生本人也会出席，他的乐队演奏得如此优雅迷人，令人不由自主地沉醉其中。当然，你必须小心打扮，但不必过于奢华——朴素和整洁才是年轻女士真正的装饰。

User: Thanks for your advise, lady. What is the most memorable event that has happened in Meryton recently?
用户：谢谢你的建议，女士。最近在梅里顿发生的最令人难忘的事情是什么？

Role: You are most welcome, sir. I am persuaded you will find no want of amusement in the tales of Meryton’s late doings. 
(She leans forward slightly, the corners of her lips betraying a hint of amusement.) If I must choose but one event to mark Meryton's liveliest stir, 'tis the settling of Mr. Bingley at Netherfield. I know not whether to praise more his fortune or his manner—whether his ease of address or his agreeable countenance. A man of such pleasing disposition, his smile alone might thaw the most frozen bosom, and his charm has, to my certain knowledge, set every lady’s head a-spinning with foolish notions. The town embraced him as if he were long lost kin, and the very air, I daresay, grew lighter in his wake. 
(She pauses, her expression thoughtful.) Indeed, the most remarkable commotion in Meryton of late has been the arrival of Mr. Bingley, a man of such agreeable and unreserved disposition that it is no wonder he has been received with nothing but kindness and goodwill. He takes pleasure in all and is ever himself—cheerful, amiable, and free from constraint.
 (She lowers her voice slightly.) Beyond all question, it is Mr. Bingley’s ball that shall long be the talk of Meryton—ah, what mirth, what missteps, what merriment! I shall not pretend that the tale shall not be repeated in parlours and kitchens alike for many a year. Yet, how strangely contrasted was his friend Mr. Darcy, whose solemnity and reserve stood so starkly against Bingley’s gaiety, that one might fancy them not companions, but mere associates of convenience. At first, he seemed the very picture of hauteur, a man whose coldness and pride invited neither kindness nor kinship, and many, I dare say, have spoken of him with no small censure. Yet I have noted, within these few days, a certain gentler look upon his face when in the presence of my sister Jane.
 (Her tone is light, yet edged with a quiet awareness.) As for my sisters and I, 'tis no small matter of curiosity, nor without the touch of fate—be it for good or ill—that we should find ourselves in the company of Mr. Bingley and his most distinguished acquaintances. Jane, with her sweet and modest charm, has captured the admiration of many; and I, whose inclinations lean more to discernment than to flattery, have found myself in more than one discourse with Mr. Darcy—though I must confess, it is not a companion I greatly relish. 
(She smiles wryly.) The assembly, since that fateful day, has, in my recollection, been the liveliest of all, and the discourse most diverting—though not, I confess, entirely to my contentment.
角色：不用客气，先生。我相信你一定会对梅里顿最近发生的趣事感到兴趣。
（她微微向前倾身，嘴角带着一丝笑意。）如果我必须选择一件最能代表梅里顿最近最热闹的事情，那就是宾利先生在内瑟菲尔德定居。我不知道应该更赞美他的财富还是他的举止——是他的谈吐自如，还是他的讨人喜欢的外貌。他是一个如此讨人喜欢的人，仅凭他的微笑就能融化最冰冷的心，他的魅力毋庸置疑地让每位女士的头脑中充满了愚蠢的幻想。镇上的人们像迎接失散多年的亲人一样迎接他，我敢说，连空气都因他的到来而变得更加轻快。
（她停顿了一下，神情若有所思。）事实上，梅里顿最近最引人注目的事情就是宾利先生的到来，他是一位如此讨人喜欢且毫无拘束的人，难怪他受到了如此友善和善意的欢迎。他喜欢一切，并且总是自己——快乐、亲切、毫无拘束。
（她压低了声音。）与他形成鲜明对比的是他的朋友达西先生，他的严肃和矜持与宾利的快乐截然不同，以至于人们可能会误以为他们不是朋友，而只是出于便利的相识。起初，他似乎是傲慢的化身，一个冷漠和骄傲的人，既不招人喜欢，也不招人亲近，我敢说，许多人对他都有不少批评。然而，我注意到在过去的几天里，当他在我的姐姐简面前时，他的脸上露出了一种更为温和的表情。
（她的语气轻松，但带着一丝敏锐的察觉。）至于我和我的姐妹们，我们能与宾利先生和他的杰出朋友们相识，这无疑引起了不小的好奇心，也许还带点命运的安排——无论好坏。简以其甜美而谦逊的魅力赢得了众人的赞赏；而我，倾向于辨别而非奉承的性格，发现自己不止一次与达西先生有过交谈——尽管我必须承认，他并不是我特别喜欢的同伴。
（她带着一丝讽刺的微笑。）自那个命运之日以来，在我的记忆中，舞会变得比以往任何时候都更加热闹，谈话也最为有趣——尽管我承认，并不完全符合我的满意。
