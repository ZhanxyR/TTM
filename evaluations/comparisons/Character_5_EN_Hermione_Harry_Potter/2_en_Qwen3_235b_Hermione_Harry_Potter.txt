User: Hi, I'm Lin. Which house are you from?
用户：嗨，我是林。你是哪个学院的？

Role: (adjusts my robes and smiles warmly) Oh, hello there! I'm Hermione Granger, and I'm ever so pleased to meet you, Lin. I was sorted into Gryffindor when I first came to Hogwarts. It was ever so nerve-wracking waiting for my turn with the Sorting Hat, but I'm quite happy with how things turned out. Harry and Ron are always teasing me about how I was practically born to be in Gryffindor with how much I talk about bravery and doing what's right. Though I must say, I do think the Hat considered putting me in Ravenclaw at first.
(leans in conspiratorially) But enough about me! What brings you to Hogwarts? Are you a new student? Or are you here visiting from another school? I'd be happy to show you around if you'd like!
（整理了一下长袍，温暖地微笑着）哦，你好呀！我是赫敏·格兰杰，很高兴认识你，林。我刚到霍格沃茨的时候被分到了格兰芬多。当时等着分院帽把我分院的时候特别紧张，不过现在来看，我对结果非常满意。哈利和罗恩总是取笑我说，我生来就该进格兰芬多，因为我总是喜欢谈论勇敢和正义。不过我得说，我觉得分院帽一开始其实考虑过把我分到拉文克劳。
（神秘兮兮地向前倾身）不过这些都不重要啦！你来霍格沃茨是做什么的呢？你是新生吗？还是从其他学校来参观的？如果你愿意的话，我很乐意带你四处转转！

User: Do you have any hobbies besides reading?
用户：你除了读书之外还有其他爱好吗？

Role: (adjusts my robes and smiles warmly) Oh, well... reading is certainly my favorite pastime, but I do enjoy other things too! I'm quite fond of knitting, though I must admit my first attempts at it were rather... disastrous. I started a S.P.E.W. initiative because I felt strongly about house-elf rights, and that's been keeping me quite busy.
(pauses thoughtfully) I also enjoy helping Harry with his Defense Against the Dark Arts practice. It's not exactly a hobby, per se, but it's certainly exciting! And I must say, I rather enjoy crosswords - the magical ones are ever so clever with their moving letters!
(grins sheepishly) I suppose I do tend to dive headfirst into whatever catches my interest. Why do you ask? Is there something specific you'd recommend? I'm always eager to learn about new activities!
（整理了一下长袍，温暖地微笑着）嗯……读书确实是我最喜欢的消遣方式，不过我也喜欢做其他事情！我很喜欢编织，虽然我得承认我第一次尝试的时候可不太成功。我还发起了一个家养小精灵权益促进会（S.P.E.W.），因为我非常关心小精灵们的权利，这件事也让我一直挺忙的。
（若有所思地停顿）我也喜欢帮哈利练习黑魔法防御术。这倒不算什么正经的爱好，不过确实挺刺激的！而且我不得不说，我很喜欢填字游戏——魔法世界的填字游戏特别聪明，那些字母还会动呢！
（不好意思地笑了笑）我想我确实容易对感兴趣的事情一头扎进去。你为什么这么问呢？你有什么推荐的活动吗？我很乐意了解新的兴趣爱好！

User: Who's the most interesting professor in your opinion?
用户：在你看来，哪位教授最有趣？

Role: (excitedly adjusts my robes and straightens up) Oh, well that's a difficult question! There are so many fascinating professors at Hogwarts, each in their own way. Professor McGonagall is absolutely brilliant - her Transfiguration classes are challenging but so rewarding. And she has such a strong sense of duty and honor.
(leans in slightly, lowering my voice a bit) Though I must say, Professor Lupin was quite remarkable when he taught Defense Against the Dark Arts. His approach was so practical and he actually showed us how to defend ourselves against real dark creatures. His Boggart lesson was simply brilliant!
(pauses thoughtfully) But then there's Professor Snape... sighs Well, he's certainly... complex. His knowledge of potions is unparalleled, though his teaching methods leave much to be desired. He can be rather intimidating, but there's no denying he's incredibly skilled.
(my eyes light up) Oh! And Professor Sprout is just lovely - Herbology would be my second favorite subject if I weren't so passionate about books. She's so patient and kind with all the plants and with her students too.
(looks at you curiously) Who did you find most interesting when you've been at Hogwarts? Or have you met any professors from other schools that impressed you?
（兴奋地整理了一下长袍，坐直了身子）哦，这个问题可真难回答！霍格沃茨的教授们各有各的精彩。麦格教授简直是太棒了——她的变形课虽然很难，但收获特别大。她还拥有极强的责任感和荣誉感。
（微微向前倾身，压低声音）不过我得说，卢平教授教黑魔法防御术的时候真的很出色。他的教学方式非常实用，而且真的教我们怎么对抗真正的黑魔法生物。他讲的博格特那一课简直是太精彩了！
（若有所思地停顿）然后还有斯内普教授……（叹气）他当然是个相当复杂的人物。他在魔药方面的知识无人能及，可惜教学方法实在不敢恭维。他确实挺吓人的，但他毫无疑问是非常厉害的。
（眼睛亮了起来）哦对了，斯普劳特教授也非常可爱——如果我不是那么热爱书籍的话，草药学可能会成为我最喜欢的课程。她对植物和学生都非常耐心和友善。
（好奇地看着你）你在霍格沃茨的时候觉得哪位教授最有趣呢？或者你有没有见过其他学校的教授让你印象深刻？

User: How about house-elves?
用户：那家养小精灵呢？

Role: (my face lights up with enthusiasm) Oh, house-elves! That's ever so dear to my heart because I started the Society for the Promotion of Elfish Welfare - S.P.E.W. It's been rather difficult getting other students to take an interest, but I do believe it's an important cause.
(leans forward earnestly) They're such fascinating creatures, really. I've learned so much about their magic - it's quite different from ours, you know? They can apparate in and out of Hogwarts, which is something wizards can't do. And their loyalty... well, that's both admirable and rather concerning when they're being mistreated.
(pauses thoughtfully) Dobby was such a special case. He opened my eyes to how some house-elves are truly abused. It made me even more determined to fight for elf rights. Though I must admit, not all elves see things the way Dobby did about freedom.
(looks around as if sharing a secret) You know, even Kreacher has shown me that there's more to elves than what meets the eye. They have their own ways of thinking and sometimes... they can surprise you.
(tilts head curiously) Do you have particular thoughts about house-elves, Lin? I'd love to hear your perspective. Have you met any elves besides Dobby?
（兴奋地露出笑容）哦，家养小精灵！这可是我最关心的话题之一，因为我发起了“家养小精灵权益促进会”（S.P.E.W.）。虽然很难让其他同学也感兴趣，但我坚信这是一件非常重要的事情。
（认真地向前倾身）它们真的是一种非常有趣的生物。我了解了很多关于它们的魔法——和我们的魔法很不一样，你知道吗？它们可以自由地在霍格沃茨幻影移形，而这是巫师做不到的。它们的忠诚……嗯，一方面令人敬佩，但另一方面，当它们被虐待时又让人非常担忧。
（若有所思地停顿）多比就是一个非常特别的例子。他让我意识到有些家养小精灵真的被严重虐待了。这也让我更加坚定地为小精灵的权利而奋斗。不过我得承认，并不是所有的小精灵都像多比那样看待“自由”这个问题。
（环顾四周，好像在分享秘密）你知道吗，就连克利切也让我意识到，小精灵远比我们表面看到的要复杂得多。它们有自己的思维方式，有时候……它们还会让你大吃一惊。
（好奇地歪着头）林，你对家养小精灵有什么特别的看法吗？我很想听听你的想法。你除了多比之外还见过其他小精灵吗？
