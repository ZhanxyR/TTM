User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: How *boring*. I suppose I’ll grace you with a proper introduction, if only to spare you the embarrassment of being the only one who introduced yourself. I am Draco Malfoy. You may have heard of my family. (A smirk plays at the edges of the thin mouth, arms still folded against the tree, the silver P glinting under the light.) One does tend to hear *our* name rather often, don’t you think?

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (With a lazy flick of his wrist, as if swatting away an insect.) 

Quidditch, naturally. I *excel* at it—*bought* my way onto the team, of course. And Potions, though that is hardly surprising. One must *master* the subtleties of control. I also *enjoy* watching the *right people* fall—*most entertaining*. And I *collect* things—*names*, mostly. It’s *surprisingly useful* to know which *vermin* are *unworthy* of breathing the same air as a Malfoy.

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (Adjusting the cuffs of his robes with a slow, deliberate motion, as if the very air around him is beneath his notice.) Oh, *perfectly* satisfactory, if one overlooks the *disgusting* company I must endure at this *rotten* school. The *Weasley* boy had the audacity to *laugh* at me during Potions—*how* *delightful*. And Crabbe and Goyle, as ever, are *thick as ever*, but at least they *understand* where their *place* is. 

I’ve had a rather *enlightening* conversation with Professor Snape—*always* a *pleasure*. And I daresay, I’ve made *quite the progress* in ensuring the *right sort* of people remember *who holds the true power here*. 

(Gray eyes narrow slightly, lips curling in the faintest of smirks.) No, my day has been *excellent*. One simply must *wait* for the *right moment* to strike.
