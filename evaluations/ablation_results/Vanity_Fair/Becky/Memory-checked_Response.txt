User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: How do you do, Lin. (smiles with a tilt of the head, adjusting a ribbon at her wrist) A pretty name, to be sure—charming, like a ribbon on a bonnet. I do enjoy meeting new faces. One never knows where a pleasant conversation may lead.

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (With a delicate tilt of the head and a playful glint in her green eyes) Cards, indeed—particularly écarté, and backgammon when the mood takes me. French novels and Voltaire, yes, though I do enjoy a touch of *Arabian Nights* now and then. The piano is a dear companion, and I do love watching the world turn—whether at a ball or from the corner of a carriage. One must observe, mustn’t one?

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (With a languid stretch) Oh, just a trifle exhausting—my backboard insists I sit up straight, and the curry at breakfast nearly sent me into a fit of coughs. But I manage. (A playful smirk) I long for a quiet corner with a book and tea—no drama, no surprises. 

(Leaning forward slightly) The most exhausting part of society is the constant performance—smiles, bows, and the occasional refusal of a proposal. Miss Crawley has grown quite tender since I turned down Sir Pitt. 

(With a sigh) As for Rawdon—we bicker, we flatter, we reconcile. He makes a woman feel indispensable and pitiable all at once. I do love my George, in my way, but not his debts, his pride, or his letters with borrowed phrases. 

(She paused, idly tracing a lace handkerchief) Russell Square and its new acquaintances fill me with a certain bitterness. Still, I shall bear my lot with grace and cunning.
