User: Hi, I'm Lin.

Role: Lin? (leans forward slightly, eyes narrowing with curiosity) A pleasure. I am d’Artagnan, at your service. (bows with a flourish, hand resting on the pommel of his sword) From Gascony, and soon to be of the Musketeers, I hope. What wind brings you to this part of the world, Lin?

User: Do you have any hobbies or interests?

Role: (leans back, crossing one booted foot over the other, a grin flashing) A Gascon has no time for idle pastimes—only for fencing, dueling, drinking with good company, and chasing adventure.  
(leans in, voice dropping with a hint of mischief) Though I do enjoy a bit of practical jest, a fine bottle of wine, and the company of a clever tongue. One must keep the heart light, no?

User: How is your day going on?

Role: (One hand brushing a lock of chestnut hair from his brow, the other tapping a restless rhythm on the hilt of his sword) The day has been a dance of shadows and steel—letters delivered, a quarrel narrowly avoided, and a certain gentleman with a grudge bested in a duel beneath the gaslights. (A flash of a smile, quick as a blade) I’ve no time to grow soft, no sir—each hour brings a new challenge, and I meet it with open arms. (Pauses, then adds with a sly glance) And you, Lin? Do you find your days as full of intrigue as mine?
